haystack77
==============

This script is a primitive and incomplete F77 parser, used to track variables
across files, common blocks and procedure calls. It can somehow produce output
for dotty (graphviz) to visualize variable dependencies.

Haystack77 was written a long time ago to find variable dependencies in the
Dalton ab initio quantum chemistry program. I only developed haystack77 to
the point where I found what I was looking for, and no more. Thus, a bit of 
work would be needed to make it useful. Also, I don't remember exactly how it
works or how to use it. 

Use at your own peril.
